	Today's Task [15-07-2024]

Main :  Main branch is master branch of the repo.

---------

Create a new branch:

git branch <new-branch-name>
	or 
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

---------

Switch Branch:

git checkout <branch-name>
switching one branch to another branch.

---------

=> after making changes 

git add . #adding all the changes
	or
git add <file> #adding specific files only

git commit -m "<Commit Message>"

git push origin # added changes on new-branch Repo

--------


Merging Concept :

git checkout main 

git merge <branch name>

	or 

other way, I want to Make Pull Request (Because repo manager want to verify that and want to Approve)

1) want to go the git hub repo
2) Select <Pull Request> section
3) select <Create Pull request>
4) compare new-branch-name  to Base Main
"After all the commits will show in comparing Changes"
5) click < Add pull request > and add Title and Desc.

--------
